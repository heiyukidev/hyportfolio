        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p>
          I love to go by the name Hei Yuki, Hei stands for "Dark" in Chinese, and Yuki stands for "Snow" in Japanese. I chose this name when I was 14 and still go with it everywhere. I hate building Apps. I just hate it, but I love modules and small pieces of
          code that just do amazing stuff, I promise I'm going to use for a big project but I just end up making more and more small modules. I'm a perfectionist, I try to make my code run as fast as I can and try to automate everything I do.Sometimes
          I even creep myself out. Attention to details, Always have something to do, hates more than anything sitting with nothing to do. If I'm in that spot (basically bored to death), I watch some conferences or go into the lab to find some more interesting
          functions in Javascript.

        <h2> Passions </h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>E-Sport :</b> Formerly an amateur league of legends player, and a hearthstone semi-pro player, I grew up with gaming as a huge part of my life. I always attended local tournaments and won a couple online tournaments. needless to say I'm a
            very competitive person. These days I just watch games when I have some time to spare, or watch live events and tell myself: Maybe I should try to be there too. </li>
          <li><b>Guitar :</b> One of the things I almost never miss is going out on Saturday (usually my day off at school) and go play guitar at a local coffee. It opens at 6am, so I make sure I'm there as early as possible so I can spend my time alone with
            my guitar. it ends up being something like 7am to 8-9am because after that it's way too crowded.
